Homework

Create an HTTP app (using express) which listens on port 30xy (xy is your class number). When a GET request comes through, the app should return a response. This response's header should specify content-type as 'application/json'. The Jain continue should be read from a file named data.json, the payload is an arbitrary json. Which I will replace. One point will be given for solution that reads the file synchronously, two points for a asynchronous solution
