Mocks:
Used for external dependencies

Stubs:
Used for transactions, file operations,

The behaviour of both can be combined

For the hw:
The date should have been const
So the test must always happen on a particular day (which was set in the mock)
Fix it!


File operations in Node:
module - > fs
const fs = require('fs');
fs.exists(path, callback);
fs.existSync(path);
fs.read()
fs.readSync()

How does the asynchronous model work?
Receives a higher order function
