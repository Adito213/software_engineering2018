This file contains examples of valid inputs to the program
The program accepts quadratic equation as command line argument and outputs it's solution

VALID INPUT EXAMPLES:
	
	5
	2x
	2x=0
	2x=-5
	-x^2
	-x^2=0
	2x^2+3x+4
	2x^2+3x+4=0
	2x^2+3x+4=5
	2x^2+3x+4=+7x
	2x^2+3x+4=-3x^2
	2x^2+3x+4=-6+5x-3x^2
	3x^2-5x^2+6-4x=-9-2x
	
The program can handle variations of the order of monomials in which they occur in the equation
Handles absence of equallity sign ("="), you can also replace "x" with every other letter

NOTE: depending on the terminal you are using you may need to type x^^2 instead of x^2 ,if errors occur when using the first notation,
try the latter, and vice versa
